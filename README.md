# Random-Bible-Verse
Created a Telegram Bot that returns a Random Bible Verse when given the command `\verse`. Used the [OurManna Bible Verse API](http://www.ourmanna.com/verses/api/). Currently working on creating an API using the Flask python library that organizes bible verses based on user emotions, and returns a bible verse suited to a specific user emotion.
